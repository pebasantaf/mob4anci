# mob4anci

In this project, a small tool has been developed that outputs which ancillary services can a certain e-mobility asset provided.
- Input a e-mobility asset, with its time availability, power, energy...
- Output a list of possible ancillary services

Moreover, the initial stages of an optimisation model to quantify the economical benefits of fleets participating in frequency control has been developed. The optimisation is based on MILP using CPLEX.
